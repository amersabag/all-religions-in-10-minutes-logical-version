# all-religions-in-10-minutes-logical-version

This is an Islamic response to the relatively fair [Christian video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTDXlIw8i20)

The idea is that, we will bring the [law of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_thought) accepted by the majority of logicians and informed reasonable people, and see if we can order the religions accordingly and try to prove that it is actually that only Islam should be picked from all the other religions if the person wants to be reasonable and compatible with the law of thought.

The plan is to pick the rules of the law of thought one by one, and see which basic tenets of each religion violate this rule, and how Islam is actually the only fully logical religion, and we will try to reuse the contents of the same mentioned video as much as possible just to emphasize how biased that video is, not only biased toward Christianity, but also biased toward the main stream narrative of making all religions relative and subjective. The video concentrate on choice instead of concentrating on evidence, which is why we think it does not reperesent the Islamic faith right, and this is the video which will fix the issue and show how regilions are sorted in the minds of Muslims.
